# Berea

## Who were the Bereans?
The Bereans are mentioned briefly in Acts 17:11 - they were a group of Jews encountered by Paul in one of his missionary journeys who "received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so."
Being "like a Berean" has become synonymous with a careful, rational studying of the Bible.


## What is this project?
At the moment it's just this readme and a bunch of vague ideas - but the Bible is a highly structured book, tightly knit together with cross references, and it would be fun to create some tools that help to explore and visualise that structure - either to aid in "Berean-like" studying, or just for kicks.
